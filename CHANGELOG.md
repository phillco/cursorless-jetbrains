## [0.0.11] - 2025-05-06

### Changed

- Intellij 2025 support.
- updated dependencies

## [0.0.10] - 2025-02-03

### Fixed

- Fix occasional NPE for language detection
- Queue editor events and dispatch in single thread, to avoid threadpool exhaustion when many editors
  are changed at the same time (e.g. branch change with many tabs open), which results in UI freeze
- Avoid using setTimeout in JS, due to memory leak causing JVM crash. Replace with shim with immediate callback.
- Fix return values from cursorless not being returned to talon, causing commands like `format at` and `phones` to fail.

### Changed

- Load ICU and WASM files from plugin dir, instead of extracting to temp dir.
  This should reduce startup time, and give less clutter in temp dir.
- Reduce logging from JS engine.
- Re-enable cursorless actions on readonly files, to enable selection.
  Commands that changes the file will still fail.
- Use one cursorless engine per project, instead of a global one. This avoids unintended edits in background
  projects, and give more stable hats when multiple projects are open. At the cost of extra memory usage.
